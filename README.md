# AirBnB

In this project we will try to explore and perform analytics on AirBnB data (Seattle) for 2016. This project is part of Udacity’s Data Science Nanodegree program. Data Courtesy - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

## Getting Started

All files required to run this project are saved in deshvi/airbnb repository.

[indexNotebook](https://github.com/deshvi/AirBnB/blob/master/indexNotebook.ipynb) maybe served as the reference document for other ipynb notebooks, individual notebooks serve specific tasks as explained in this notebook. All future work would be in one consolidated notebook.

[Blog Post](http://https://medium.com/@vinaydeshpande_24482/data-trend-analysis-of-seattle-airbnb-data-8101abb7f053 "Blog Post") for fulfillment of this assignment is posted on Medium.

The objective of keeping separate notebooks is because this is my first published Data Science Assignment.

## Prerequisites & installation

Installation of conda is desired for ease of use of libraries. More information for installation of conda and repositories can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).  Built on Python 3.7.4. IPython 7.9.0 is used explicitly to run the code for simplicity and ease of use.
